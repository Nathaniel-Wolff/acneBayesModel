    "# Analysis Structure and Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Dataset is found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manuelhettich/acne04. Consists of n = 10 synthetic patients, \n",
    "with acne severity recorded over 112 distinct days of treatment (each indexing a distinct treatment history).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis Steps\n",
    "#### 1) Data Parsing -\n",
    "Base dataframe is seperated by patient. Raw acne severities are normalized as % change relative to patient average baseline intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2) Treatment History Metadata Addition - \n",
    "A treatment history metadata column is added to each patient dataframe. Histories are of the form ( (Treatment $a_{1}$, Day 1),...(Treatment $a_{n}$, Day i)), where n is the index of a given treatment in the full history.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3) Kernel Density Estimation of normalized acne severity change -\n",
    "Over all patient dataframes, the distribution of normalized acne severity over all histories and patients is obtained, and a Kernel Density Estimate is fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4) Optimization of KDE and Discretization of Acne Severity Change into 3 states -\n",
    "The KDE is optimized for local maxima and saddle points; corresponding quantiles define an acne severity change states.  \n",
    "*In progress: dynamic decision of state number.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5) Validation of Discretization via Quantile Bootstrapping -\n",
    "Before binning normalized acne severities into change states, the robustness of binning is assessed via bootstrapping of each quantile. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6) Calculation of Acne Severity Change State Distribution Series over treatment sequence - \n",
    "With an uninformative Dirhclet prior and multinomial likelihood,  posterior distributions of acne severity change states are calculated for each treatment history. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7) Calculation of information cost between consecutive distributions - \n",
    "Kullback-Leibler divergence is calculated between consecutive treatment history posteriors. Cumulative KL divergence represents the information cost of not updating distribution from day to day, a descriptor of distance between distributions. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8) Determination of Diminishing Returns: Fitting of Univariate Spline to Cumulative KL divergence curve - \n",
    "A univariate spline curve is fit to the cumulative KL Divergence of the entire treatment series. The curve's first derivative is evaluated against a threshold (\"p value\"), returning sections of non-diminishing returns in treatment. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 9) Fitting of Linear Model to Non-Diminishing Treatment Returns' Cumulative KL Divergence\n",
    "A linear regression model is fit to each non-diminishing return section. Histories are plotted on the x-axis. The systems biology/biochemical implications of these sections are used to determine the form of the predictive model below.\n"
